## Introduction
Wirecamel is a Python based project aimed to automate the use of SSL Split in an IoT security auditing context and
help retrieve human readable data.

The main goal is a security audit for IoTs. It creates an access point (configurable by the auditor), allowing the IoT
or the smartphone to connect to it. Then, a MITM (Man In The Middle) attack is performed to watch exchanged data. As
said previously, the result is human readable an easy to understand by non technical professionnals.
